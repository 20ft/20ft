=================
20ft is different
=================

There's no orchestrator, no DSL and no guessing about what's going on. 20ft is directly commanded, starting with a simple command line client; and ultimately using the fully OO SDK to produce standalone dynamic container applications.

There's no need to create a cluster, no need to police VM usage, no danger of removing the wrong container and no visibility between user sessions. It's compatible with Docker's containers and development tools so solutions developed on 20ft are portable to other environments (and vice versa).

If container development seems complex don't worry, it's not - "the easy way" has been the guiding mantra for 20ft's development and as a result it's clear, minimal and focussed.

Let's get started...
